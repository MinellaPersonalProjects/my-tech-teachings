VueJS is a progressive JavaScript framework that makes building modern web applications a breeze. With a good UI framework like Vuetify and a build tool like Vite building web apps become even breezier.

Starting a Vue project from scratch may seem tricky, but with the right guidance, it can be a rewarding and straightforward process. In this blog post, I will take you through the essential steps to start your Vue project from the ground up with Vuetify and Vite. By the end of this guide, you'll have a solid foundation for creating dynamic and interactive web applications using Vue.js.





## Step  0 : SetUp Computer and Install DevTools

Before diving into your Vue project setup, ensure you have the necessary tools ready. If you're already familiar with the command line, have a code editor, and Node.js installed, feel free to skip ahead.However, if you're new to these essentials, don't worry! We've got you covered. 

If you're new to web development and need guidance on setting up your computer, I recommend starting with my tutorial titled,

[Getting Started with Web Development: Setting Up Your Computer for React, Vue, and JavaScript Programming]()

Once you've completed the initial setup, return here, and let's dive into creating your Vue project.



## Step 1 : Create a Folder to Host your Project

Let's start organizing your project. We'll create a dedicated folder where your Vue + Vite + Vuetify project will live. This folder will keep all your project files neat and organized. 

### Create a New Directory

First, open your command line or terminal and navigate to a location where you'd like to create your project folder. For example, you can go to your "Documents" folder. Use the following command:

```bash
  cd Documents
```

### Make the Project Folder

Now, create a new directory for your project. You can name it whatever you like; for this example, we'll call it "my-vue-project." Use the following command to create the folder:

```bash
  mkdir my-vue-project
```

### Navigate into the Folder

Then, navigate into it using the following command :

```bash
  cd my-vue-project
```

### Open Folder in VSCode

In your **VSCode** , open the folder you just created to begin making changes to it by going to File > Open in your Menu Bar then navigating to your “Documents”  directory , where you created the "my-vue-project" folder. Select the folder with your project's name (e.g., "my-vue-project"). Then, click the "Open" button.

## Step 2 : Initialize the Project and Edit Your Package.json

### Initialize Project

Now that we have our project folder set up, we'll initialize a new Node.js project by typing `npm init` on your command line. This command will guide you through setting up your project's details and creating a `package.json` file

![Screenshot 2023-10-08 at 11.23.17 AM.png](/img/blog1/Screenshot_2023-10-08_at_11.23.17_AM.png)

 

### Edit Package.json

After running `npm init`, a `package.json` file will be generated. However, for our specific Vue project, we need to add a few customizations to this file. You can create the `package.json` file yourself or edit the one generated by `npm init`. Here's a sample `package.json` format that you can use as a starting point:

```javascript{1-16}[package.json]
    {
      "name": "my-vue-project",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "description": "my vue project",
      "private": true,
      "scripts": {
        "dev": "vite",
        "build": "vite build",
        "preview": "vite preview",
        "lint": "eslint . --fix --ignore-path .gitignore"
      },
      "dependencies": { 
      },
        "devDependencies": {
        },
    }
    
```

In this `package.json` file:

- `"name"` specifies the name of your project.
- `"version"` indicates the project's version.
- `"description"` provides a brief description of your project.
- `"private": true` ensures that your project remains private.
- `"scripts"` defines  custom commands to run your application. The left side value is the name you'll use to run the script, and the value on the right is the command that will be executed when you run that script
- `"dependencies"` is used to specify the JavaScript packages (or modules) that your project depends on to run.
- `"devDependencies"` is for development dependencies, like build tools and linters. It contains packages that are required for development and testing purposes

### Install 

After initializing the application, run the command :

```bash
  npm i
```



## Step 3 : Install Dependencies

For our project we’re using vuetify and vite and we’ll need the dependencies for our app to run. The commands to install those dependencies are listed below :

```bash
  npm i vue vuetify vite @vitejs/plugin-vue vite-plugin-vuetify @mdi/font 
```

```bash
  npm install -D sass
```

You will notice a `node_modules` folder appear in your directory.


## Step 4 : Create Vite Config File and Style Settings

### Create the Vite Config File

Vite empowers you with greater control over your project's configuration through the use of 'vite.config.js' or 'vite.config.ts,' which reside in the root directory of your project.

To begin, let's create a `vite.config.js` file in the root directory of your project. This file will contain the configuration settings for Vite. Here's an example of what the `vite.config.js` file might look like:

```javascript
    // Plugins
    import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'
    import vuetify, { transformAssetUrls } from 'vite-plugin-vuetify'
    
    // Utilities
    import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
    import { fileURLToPath, URL } from 'node:url'
    
    // https://vitejs.dev/config/
    export default defineConfig({
      plugins: [
    
    /* handle vuejs configurations*/
        vue({
          template: { transformAssetUrls }
        }),
        
    /* integrate vuetify ui framework into project */
        vuetify({
          autoImport: true,
          styles: {
            /* set style config file, settings.scss */
            configFile: 'src/styles/settings.scss',
          },
        }),
      ],
      define: { 'process.env': {} },
      resolve: {
    
    /* alias is set to map the '@' symbol to the project's src 
        ie instead of defining a path as src/plugins, 
        you can instead use @/plugins to mean the same thing*/
        alias: {
          '@': fileURLToPath(new URL('./src', import.meta.url))
        },
    
    /* specify the file extensions that Vite should 
            consider when resolving modules*/
        extensions: [
          '.js',
          '.json',
          '.javascript',
          '.mjs',
          '.ts',
          '.tsx',
          '.vue',
        ],
      },
    /* configure development server */
      server: {
        port: 3000,
      },
    })
```

### Create a Style Settings Folder

Next, create an empty folder called `styles` in your project directory. Inside the `styles` folder, create a file named `settings.scss`. This file will be used for adding custom styling to override default UI framework styles.


## Step 5 : Create Index.html file and Public Folder

### Create the `index.html` file

Your Vue app needs an HTML entry point. We'll create an `index.html` file where your Vue application will be mounted. In your parent folder, create an `index.html` file. You can use the code below as a starting point :

```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
        <title>Hello World</title>
      </head>
    
      <body>
        <div id="app"></div>
        <script type="module" src="/src/main.js"></script>
      </body>
    </html>
```

Here's what these sections of the **`index.html`** file does:

- **`<link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico">`**: This line links to the favicon, which is the small icon you see in the browser tab.
- **`<title></title>`**: You can set the title to the name of your website or web app.
- **`<body></body>`**: This section provides a placeholder for your Vue application to be mounted, and the **`<script>`** tag loads your Vue application's JavaScript code from **`main.js`**.

### Set Up the `public` Folder:

Create a folder named **`public`** in your project directory. Within the **`public`** folder, you can save your favicon image . In this folder you can save [this image](https://w7.pngwing.com/pngs/603/872/png-transparent-donuts-homer-simpson-drawing-render-simpson-donut-purple-eating-magenta.png) and rename it `favicon.ico` . Alternatively, you can choose your own favicon image online. The favicon is the small icon displayed in the browser tab.The favicon icon is something similar to the icon you see here :

![Screenshot 2023-10-06 at 6.25.44 AM.png](/img/blog1/Screenshot_2023-10-06_at_6.25.44_AM.png)

By following these steps, you'll have your **`index.html`** file ready as the entry point for your Vue app, and your **`public`** folder will store assets like the favicon, enhancing the appearance and functionality of your web application.



## Step 6: Create the Vue App

Now, we're going to create **`App.vue` , `main.js`** and **`src` folder**, which contain the main components of our Vue app. This is where the magic happens! You'll create the core structure of your Vue application. We'll set up the `src` folder, create the main Vue component (`App.vue`), and write the entry point (`main.js`) to bootstrap your app. You'll start to see your project take shape.

### Create `App.vue`

In the project root create a file called `App.vue` and you can copy the following code snippet into that :

```vue
    <template>
      <h1> Hello World </h1>
    </template>
    
    <script setup>
      //
    </script>
```

### Create `main.js`

Next, create a file named **`main.js`**. This file serves as the entry point for your Vue application. It initializes Vuetify and other necessary plugins and mounts the **`App.vue`** component:

```javascript

    // Components
    import App from './App.vue'
    
    // Composables
    import { createApp } from 'vue'
    
    // Plugins
    import { registerPlugins } from '@/plugins'
    
    const app = createApp(App)
    
    registerPlugins(app)
    
    app.mount('#app')
```

### Create the `src` Folder:

Then we need to create the `src` folder, think of the **`src`** folder as the place where all the important code for your website or web app lives

### Create the `plugins` Folder inside `src` Folder:

In this `src` folder we’ll create another folder called  `plugins` ,  this folder contains the setup information for some of the additional ui frameworks or functionality that you may want to add in your project. 

Under this folder, create a file called `index.js` . This file plays a crucial role in configuring and registering various plugins for your Vue application:

 **index.js** 

```javascript
    import vuetify from './vuetify'
    
    export function registerPlugins (app) { 
        app.use(vuetify)
    }
```

Since we are using Vuetify we will create a `vuetify.js`  file under plugins to add some extra styling information for the framework

**vuetify.js**

```javascript
    import { createVuetify } from 'vuetify'
    
    // Styles
    import '@mdi/font/css/materialdesignicons.css'
    import 'vuetify/styles'
    
    export default createVuetify({
        theme: {
          themes: {
            light: {
              colors: {
                primary: '#1867C0',
                secondary: '#5CBBF6',
              },
            },
          },
        },
      })
```

With these steps completed, your Vue project structure is taking shape, and you're all set to embark on your web development journey with Vue and Vuetify.

At the end, your file structure should look something like this :

## Step 7 : Run App

Now, it's time to see your Vue app in action. Follow these simple steps to run your application locally:

### Run the Development Server:

Open your command line or terminal, and in the project's root directory, enter either of the following commands, depending on your package manager:

```bash
  npm run dev
```

or

```bash
  yarn dev
```

### Access Your App:

Once you run the command, you'll see an output in your terminal that resembles the following:

![Screenshot 2023-10-06 at 6.16.59 AM.png](/img/blog1/Screenshot_2023-10-06_at_6.16.59_AM.png)

This message indicates that your development server is up and running. It's serving your Vue app at **`http://localhost:3000`**.

If you copy the URL into your web browser, you’ll see your Vue app live in your browser

![Screenshot 2023-10-06 at 6.27.36 AM.png](/img/blog1/Screenshot_2023-10-06_at_6.27.36_AM.png)

By following these steps, you can seamlessly run your Vue app on your local development server and start exploring and testing your project in a real web browser environment.
