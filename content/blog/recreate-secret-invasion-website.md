If you didn't already know, Marvel created a secret website for its newest tv show , Secret Invasion. This novel promotional stunt had my hands itching to create a something similar. The website, [www.theinvasionhasbegun.com](http://www.theinvasionhasbegun.com/)  gives a black-ops aesthetics and surreptitious layout of this site create an atmosphere of secrecy and intrigue, making users feel like they're part of an underground network.

The website starts out with a password prompt page, with an obscure password that I had to get off the internet. 

One might expect the password to have a connection to the show, possibly involving names like "Nick Fury" or "Avengers" However, due to the absence of a character limit on the website, the possibilities appeared to be without boundaries.I couldn't figure out any clues so I just googled it, the password is "RSD3PX5N7S"

This tutorial isn’t for complete beginners, you so need some knowledge of JavaScript and Vue to fully grasp everything. Luckily I’ve got you.
