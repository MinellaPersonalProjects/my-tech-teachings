I always enjoy exploring new JavaScript frameworks, and recently, I stumbled upon NestJS. What intrigued me most about NestJS was its clean practices, clear separation of concerns, and well-structured architecture. I decided to port a project I had initially built with Express to NestJS. The process started off pretty seamless, thanks to NestJS's built-in tools and commands that simplify setup and promote clean design. Even better, its robust [documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com), filled with helpful examples of core principles, made it easy to get started.

I was hooked. The codebase's organization scratched an itch in my brain I wasn't even aware of. However, as my project grew more complex, I found myself struggling to keep track of all the moving parts. It was a humbling experience that taught me a lot about using NestJS effectively.

This tutorial is for anyone looking to jump into NestJS. My goal is to provide a quick start guide and help you avoid some of the mistakes I made along the way.
