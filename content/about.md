# About Me

My name is Nkem, I live in Chicago, IL, and I am a Software Engineer at a company called [CCC Intelligent Solutions](https://cccis.com). I have had the opportunity to work on several interesting projects that have honed my skills and problem-solving abilities. My journey has included immersive experiences in the dynamic realms of Web Development and AI Platform Development.

I'm committed to continuous learning and growth, regularly participating in online courses and coding projects to expand my skill set. Here is some more information about me :

## Background

### Education

I hold a B.Sc. in Software Engineering from [Loyola University Chicago](https://www.luc.edu) where I graduated in December 2021 with Honors _Magna Cum Laude_.

### Experience

During my time as a student at Loyola, I received a Mulcahy Fellowship Grant to research the security of DNS Over HTTPS. I presented my findings to my mentor and the fellowship foundation.

I also had an 8-week internship at OntoAdaptive LLC, where I conducted independent research on adopting a modern web stack on an existing reference architecture. At the end of the internship, I successfully implemented a React TypeScript Infrastructure as a result of my research.

After graduating from Loyola, I was hired by CCC Intelligent Solutions and since February 2022, I have completed a variety of projects and roles from web development to AI platform development.

At CCC, I started as an AI Enablement Intern and was later promoted to a Software Engineer. Here I participated in the development of a cutting-edge AI Platform. I have also created a host of Vue Web Apps to showcase some of the company's AI applications.

When I am not at work, I create fun new projects, many of which I'll talk about in my blog. I am dedicated to learning new things and love creative projects.

**Programming Languages:** JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Golang, C++
